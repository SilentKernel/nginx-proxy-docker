# Scans the candidate and, when given, the published image (pulled here), with the same
# vulnerability DB. Fails only on a fixable CRITICAL the candidate has and the published image has
# not (scripts/trivy-diff.py): the nightly must never publish a new fixable critical, but what
# production already has must not block a security update either.
# Fixable HIGH and what both images share are reported, with an ntfy alert. A scan that cannot run
# fails too: a gate that passes when its scanner is down is no gate.
# Writes trivy-report.json / trivy-report.txt (candidate) and trivy-published.json at the repo root
# (gitignored, CI artifacts).
